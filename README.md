# OSP Workshop Control Repo

This is a Puppet [control repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/control-repo)
containing roles, profiles, and data to install and configure a basic reference
for Puppet Server, PuppetDB, and Foreman, all integrated but managed
independently. It is intended to be used with the
[osp_workshop](https://github.com/jameslikeslinux/osp_workshop) Bolt project.
