# OSP Managed Prometheus Control Repo

This is a Puppet [control repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/control-repo)
containing roles, profiles, and data to install and configure a basic reference
for Puppet Server, PuppetDB, and Prometheus, all integrated but managed
independently. It is intended to be used with the
[osp_managed_prom](https://github.com/jameslikeslinux/osp_managed_prom) Bolt
project.
